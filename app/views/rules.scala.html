            <div class="box">
                <p>There are 3 phases in the game.</p>
                <ol type ="1">
                    <li>Place</li>
                    <li>Move</li>
                    <li>Fly</li>

            <h3>Place</h3>
            <div class="box">
                <p>Before the game starts a coin has to be tossed to decide who will play white - white then moves first. <br>
                    White has to place a stone on a free point of its choice. Then black has to place a stone. This continues until all 18 stones have been placed. <br>
                </p>
            </div>
            <h3>Move</h3>
            <div class="box">
                <p>Now the player can move a stone to a free adjacent point along the lines</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Fly</h3>
            <div class="box">
                <p>When a player has only 3 stones left he can move a stone to any free point on the board</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Case of mill</h3>
            <div class="box">
                <p>If 3 stones of one colour form a line the player can remove a stone of his opponent which isn't in a mill (If all the stones are in a mill this rule doesnt apply) <br>
                    The stones remain outside the board and cant be placed back on it
                </p>
            </div>
            <h3>Game ending</h3>
            <p>The game ends if one player has only 2 Stones left. The other player wins the game</p>
